# ESP32-CAM & BME280/680 & Home Assistant & ESPHome integration
Using **ESP32-CAM** (AI-Thinker) with Bosch Sensors **[BME280](https://www.bosch-sensortec.com/products/environmental-sensors/humidity-sensors-bme280/)/[BME680](https://www.bosch-sensortec.com/products/environmental-sensors/gas-sensors/bme680/)** via I2C and its integration into **[Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) via [Esphome](https://esphome.io/)**. With some small modifications you can use this code also for other boards e.g. ESP01/ESP12/... which I already tried as well.

*Note:* **[BME280](https://www.bosch-sensortec.com/products/environmental-sensors/humidity-sensors-bme280/)** is a temperature sensor. **[BME680](https://www.bosch-sensortec.com/products/environmental-sensors/gas-sensors/bme680/)** is a gas sensor.

# Intro

I was personally struggling to find out comprehensive tutorial, how to integrate ESP32-CAM together with any kind of Bosch sensor via I2C. The main motivation has been to use just one microcontroller (in this case ESP32-CAM) for everything - camera & temperature/gas sensor. 

# Wiring

Here in general pinout of **ESP32-CAM**. The **GPIO** names are important to set **[I2C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C2%B2C)** corrcetly. To this poin we will come again when we write the code.
